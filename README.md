# David's bachelor's thesis on creating a BCI Application Platform
In this repo, I have tracked the work on my bachelor's thesis. The paper is written in LaTeX because I'm a CompSci graduate so of course it is. The thesis is a predominantly practical paper regarding the creation and development of a platform that houses BCI applications.  
The platform program interfaces with the Unicorn Speller for input inside the application platform and is compatible with the Unicorn Hybrid Black BCI. A Unicorn Speller license is needed (or a different speller, it's a free world).  
Alongside the platform, I have created an installer which uses GitHub releases to curl the applications and download them to a specific directory.  
  
This repository contains only the actual paper of my thesis. The application side of the paper is stored in 2 separate repos, one for the [Application Platform](https://github.com/DavidVuescu/BCI-Apps-Platform) and one for the [Application Installer](https://github.com/DavidVuescu/BCI-Apps-Platform-Installer).
